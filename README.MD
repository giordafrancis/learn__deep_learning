# Deep Learning Studies

This repository documents my journey through FastAI's deep learning courses and materials.

 ## Current Focus
 - FastAI's "Deep Learning for Coders" (Part 1 and Part 2)
 - FastAI Book

 ## Repository Contents
 - Jupyter notebooks with code examples and exercises
 - Notes on key concepts and techniques
 - Personal projects applying learned concepts

 ## Resources
 - [FastAI Course](https://course.fast.ai/)
 - [FastAI Book](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook)

 ## Progress Tracker
 - [x] Part 1: 
 - [ ] Part 2: [Completed up to Lesson 19]
 - [X] FastAI Book: [Your current progress]

 ## Key Learnings
 

 - Matrix multiplication
 - Broadcasting rules
 - Datasets and DataLoading
 - Importance of a good train, test, validation split to repr our real world example
 - Mean shift clustering
 - Back propagation and Multi layer perceptron
 - Autoencoders
 - Learner framework
    - Basic Learner to Advanced learner with CallBacks at any point of training
    - pytorch Forward Hooks for registering functions in the model
        - Activation Stats tracking (% dead(mean 0) and variance of the layer activations); fundamental for visual understanding of what is going wrong with our training
 - Weight initialisation (Xavier/Glorot, Kaiming Her, data driven LSUV)
- Optimisers (regular SGD, Momentum,RMS prop, ADAM )
- Schedulers (Regular, Cosine)
- LR finder and fit one cycle strategies
- Normalisation (Layer Norm, Batch Norm)
- CNN, Resnets Architectures
- Data augmentation strategies for computer vision
- Test Time augmentation
- Model Ensemple


 ## Projects
 - Fashion Mnist
 - Hair Style dataset

 ## Goals
 - Gain a practical understanding of deep learning
 - Understand hands on and implement various neural network architectures
 - Apply deep learning to real-world problems

 ## Notes
 - Complete reviewed notebooks will be presented in the main folder:
    - p1,p2,fb prefix to reference the nb provenance from course or book
    - fgs prefix are my owen projects
    - fgs suffix notebooks ive decided to go for a deeper dive
